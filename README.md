# Lending Club Case Study
> This project is a case study on a consumer finance company that specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers. We are provided a huge dataset containing information about the past loan applicants, their details and whether they 'defaulted' or not. The purpose of this case study is for us to perform Exploratory Data Analysis on the given dataset and identify patterns that indicate if a person is likely to default, which may used for taking suitable actions by the company.

## General Information
- General information about the project:
We are students of Executive Post Graduate Programme in AI & ML. This project is a test of the EDA concepts that we have learnt as part of the curriculum of this programme.
- Background of the project:
We have been taught concepts of EDA, i.e., Data Cleaning, Univariate Analysis, Bivariate Analysis, Multivariate Analysis and Derived Metrics that we have applied here.
- Business Problem that this project is trying to solve:
This case study is about applying concepts learnt in EDA to identify risky loan applicants so that the amount of credit loss can be reduced.
- Dataset that is being used:
The dataset used in this project is 'loan.csv' file which contains information about the past loan applicants and various relevant details about them.

## Conclusions
1. For borrowers with "**High Annual Income, Low Debt-To-Income Ratio**" - Approve higher loan amounts with competitive interest rates.
2. For borrowers with "**High Grades (A, B) with Verified Income**" - Approve loans readily as these applicants show strong repayment records.
3. For borrowers with "**Mid Grades (C) with Moderate Debt-To-Income Ratio**" - Approve with stricter terms and possibly higher interest rates.
4. For borrowers with "**High Revolving Balances but Low Debt-To-Income Ratio**" - Approve with caution, ensuring the applicant's financial management is stable.
5. For borrowers with "**Low Grades (D, E) with High Debt-To-Income Ratio**" - Deny the loan or require substantial collateral.
6. For borrowers with "**Presence of Derogatory Public Records**" - Deny the loan or require co-signers or additional guarantees.
7. For borrowers with "**High Interest Rates with Low Annual Income**" - Deny or approve with significantly reduced loan amounts and higher interest rates.
